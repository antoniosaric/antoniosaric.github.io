				<h2>Changing The Future</h2>

					<p>
						Asteroid mining is the next stage in the human engineering evolution. It will be comparable to the industrial revolution. Asteroid minding will consist of automated satelites, that will travel to near earth asteroids and mine them. The satelites will bring the raw material to earth for processing. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Technology will need to be refined in order for the automated satelies to adequately mine the material. The satelites will need to be equipped with sensors sensitive enough to find valuable deposites. The satelites will also need to have adequate AI to determine what steps would be necessary in order to optain the maximum yield. 
					</p>


					<p>
						The astoroid mining industry is expected to be the first trillion dollar business and could open up a 100 trillion market. Additionaly, since Obama signed space right to private companies, this will cause a boom in investments in space mining. Luxembourg has already invested 225 million dollars into entrepreneurial space companies to begin building the infrustructure. We could being to see these probes withing 3 years, but will most likely become a relaity by 2025.
